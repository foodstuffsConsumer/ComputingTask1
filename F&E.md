# Feedback Evaluation

Out of my three potential designs, the first one was universally deemed great or at least decent, while the other two were seen as mediocre or downright horrendous. Good. I didn't like those two anyways.

## DESIGN ONE

Recieved generally positive feedback, especially in terms of aesthetics. One user noted it was a bit airy, but excused it as a side effect of making the design leaning more towards aesthetics.

## DESIGN TWO

Generally seen as mediocre - not terrible, but not exactly good either. While there was no problem with functionality or use of space, critics noted the design as corporate, or resembling a letter.

## DESIGN THREE

Definitely recieved the worst feedback in all three departments; aesthetics, functionality, and spacing. To quote a paragraph from one of the reviewers:

    'Make sure [the final design] does not resemble design 3 in any way, shape or form. It is ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE that you NEVER release design 3 from it's enclosure. Shackle it in the deepest pits of hell if you must. It must NEVER see the light of day AGAIN.'
    
# Final Thoughts - What I've learned
A website especially pertaining to a humourous book such as the Hitchhiker's Guide would generally benefit more with a design focusing on aesthetics, especially since the website itself isn't too complex anyways.
