# Social Impact

## Target Audience And Accessability
The website is intended for an audience which has a general interest in the Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.
Possible accessability features include larger text and an interface which allows for ease of navigation.

## Potential Benefits
The project's main draw is encouraging reading of the Hitchhiker's Guide series, as well as serving as a fun little widget for pre-existing Hitchhiker's Guide fans.

## Potential Risks

# Ethical Responsibilities

## User Data & Privacy
The prototype will not require any collection of user data, nor will it attempt to do so, with the possible exception of user feedback.

## Representation
The prototype should represent all the major characters in the book equally, and should fairly represent the book's theme and tone.

## Content Sensitivity
The Hitchhiker's Guide makes generous use of dark humour, which may be sensitive to new readers.

# Legal Consideration

## Copyright & Intellectual Property
No images from the book itself will be used. However, images from any external source will be used, which will require crediting.
As per Australia copyright laws, up to 10% of material directly from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy can be used for study purpose, which allows for usage of quotes.
