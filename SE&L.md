# Social Impact

## Target Audience And Accessability
The website is intended for an audience which has a general interest in the Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.
Possible accessability features include larger text and an interface which allows for ease of navigation.

## Potential Benefits
The project's main draw is encouraging reading of the Hitchhiker's Guide series, as well as serving as a fun little widget for pre-existing Hitchhiker's Guide fans.

# Ethical Responsibilities

## User Data & Privacy
The prototype will not require any collection of user data, nor will it attempt to do so, with the possible exception of user feedback.

## Representation
The prototype should represent all the major characters in the book equally, and should fairly represent the book's theme and tone.

## Content Sensitivity
The series contains plenty of dark humour, but it should not be sensitive content for the series' target age.

# Legal Consideration

## Copyright & Intellectual Property
No images from the book itself will be used. As per Australia copyright laws, up to 10% of material directly from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy can be used for study purposes, which the website will use less than - as a result, the site is in the clear.
